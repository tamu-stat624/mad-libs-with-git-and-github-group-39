Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Loney,

I am writing to you from a tall spaceship in a beautiful galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a yellow rocket in July. There are 7 birds and apples of Elephant here! In the
bedroom there is a pool full of water. I fall asleep each night on a tranquil bed of
diamond and dream of skydiving eternally. It feels as though I have lived here for
4 [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
